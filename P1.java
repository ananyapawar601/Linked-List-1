// Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

//Recursive solution

// Time Complexity : O(N) because the algorithm traverses the linked list twice: once to push the values onto the stack, and once to pop the values and update the linked list. 
//Since each node is visited during both traversals, the time complexity is linear, O(N).
// Space Complexity :    O(1)
